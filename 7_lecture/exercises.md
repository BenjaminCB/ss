```

For 3c just convert the follow CFG to a PDA
```
S -> 0 | A0A
A -> 0 | 1
```

### Exercise 4
These will be the exact same an NFA can be considered a PDA that does not use its stack, thus we just have to add extra notation to and convert the transition function such that it has a stack, but never uses it.

### Exercise 5
