# Exercise Session 8
## Exercise 1
### 1.1
I'll assume that it's the two similar languages $L_2$ and $L_3$

I'll also assume that the proofs are very similar, so i will only be doing the one.

```
S -> aAbB
A -> aAb
   | EMPTY
B -> cB
   | EMPTY
```

### 1.2
Let the word be $a^pb^pc^p$ then by default neither condition 2 nor 3 can hold.

### 1.3
Because $L_2 \cap L_3 = L_1$, we have found an example of two CFGs that intersect into a non-CFG, thus disproving the fact that CFGs are cloned under intersection.

## Exercise 2
### 2.1
#1, 10#101

01#10, 10#

### 2.2
Let the word be $1^p#1^p0^p$ Now

## Exercise 3
### 3.1
It is not based on p, and they are just choosing the partitioning, instead of forcing it.

### 3.2


# Exercise 4
- Set the pumping length, we cannot do that without having the productions rules.
- select a single split of s

# Exercise 5
Just read the book formulation and compare.
